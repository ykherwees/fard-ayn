Basically gonna split this thing into a few High level segments (all fo this is work in progress and subject to change)

1. Knowledge Topics
   * These are high level topics, each equally important and separate enough that they can be studied separately. Perhaps a breakdown of topics could be:
     * 5 Pillars of Islam / Intro to the necessety of the knowledge
     * Belief (Covering Aqeedah, 6 Pillars)
     * Tahara
     * Prayer
     * (Maybe in the future) Fasting 
     * Hajj
   * each will have its own page and link in the top navigation
   * Each Topic page will have something like the following (depending on how much wed prefer to put into the specific subtopics):
     * Topic overview and breakdown into subtopics (e.g. Tahara breaks down to Wudhu & Ghusl)
     * Videos (if organized as a series instead of mapping directly to subtopics)
     * FAQ for the topic
     * Topic Quiz
     * Submit a question to the sheikh
2. About essential knowledge in general
